      <h1 class="name">The Nature of Truth</h1>
      <p class="content">
        Truth is absolute.  It is not defined by belief, opinion, experience or hope.  The search for truth is the essence of science and, many would agree, the driving force in our lives.

        <br>Unfortunately, truth is often denied, hidden, altered or ignored, usually to achieve personal benefit or opportunity; indeed, individuals may refuse to accept truth that elicits unwelcome doubt or complicates their life.  Too often, humans create their own reality and live within the safe confines of that belief system.

        <br>Whether we spend our lives seeking and responding to truth or avoiding it, truth prevails.  It governs our lives, our relationships, our environment and our Universe.  We ignore truth at our own peril.
